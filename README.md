# I design and program beautiful and simple things, and I love what I do.

## Hi, I'm Josue Fischer. Pleased to meet you.

> Since beginning my journey as a software designer and developer, I've done remote work for startups, mentored startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for consumer and commercial use. I am naturally curious and perpetually work to improve my skills, one problem at a time.

## Designer

## Things I enjoy designing:

## Design and editing tools:
> Figma, Canva, Photoshop, Adobe XD, Filmora, Adobe Premiere Pro.

## Front End Developer

## Languages I speak:
> HTML, CSS, Python, Java.
